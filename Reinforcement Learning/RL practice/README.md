### The goal of this RL project

1. Help me study / review RL concepts from UB
2. Build materials so I can build RL course on Udemy
3. Help me understand and train reasoning LLM model from scratch


### Roadmap - 6 months:
- Q-learning + Double Qlearning + Sarsa: basic, train some basic gym environments
- DQN, Double DQN, Rainbow DQN, : train atari, breakout, other atari, ...
- Policy gradient: REINFORCE
- Actor-critic methods like A2C, 
- DDPG: mujoco, gym env, 
- PPO: train Mujoco, humanoid
- GRPO: mujoco
- TD3: mujoco
- use RL to train LLM reasoning model
### Extra to robotics - 3 months 
- Find quadruple leg robot training simulation to train a robot
- model-based RL methods
- immitation learning
